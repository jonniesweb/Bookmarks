Every year Sys Advent has great articles dealing with new stuff going on surrounding Ops, Dev, DevOps and hot technologies. The posts are well written and go into depth. Many times after reading I've come away asking myself questions, discovering and teaching new technologies and methodologies. It's perfect during the holidays since you have time off and want to learn fun new things and play around at your own pace.
