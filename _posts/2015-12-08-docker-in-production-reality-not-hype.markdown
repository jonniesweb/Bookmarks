Here's the first article that got me interested in Docker. It's a quick introduction to Docker. It appeared in SysAdvent, an excellent collaboration between writers on interesting technologies around Ops and DevOps. I had a lot of time on my 20 minute bus ride to work in the wintertime, so I read a lot of articles every day. I think the evening after reading that article I tried out everything in the post. Then I was hooked. No turning back.
