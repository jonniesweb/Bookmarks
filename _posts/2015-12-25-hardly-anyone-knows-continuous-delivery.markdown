It might seem common in tech companies, but continuous delivery isn't that widespread and understood. It's possibly one of the biggest productivity and agile boosters besides continuous integration, therefore every person involved in the software lifecycle should know of it and understand the benefits.

Delivering software shouldn't be hard and shouldn't take long. Even a legacy codebase can be continuously delivered.

This article states the lack of people who know what continuous delivery is, and offers some very good resources for informing others. Both the Continuous Delivery and The Phoenix Project books I can highly recommend. DevOpsDays conferences are also mentioned as an excellent source of learning. Lastly, any DevOps meetup in your area is great to bring your coworkers to.
